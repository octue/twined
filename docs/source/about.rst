About Twines
============

**Twined** is a framework for describing a digital twin or data service.

We call these descriptions "twines". To just get started building a *twine*, check out the :ref:`quick_start`. To
get into the detail of what's in a *twine*, see :ref:`anatomy`.

Here, we look at requirements for the framework, our motivations and background, and some of the decisions made while
developing **twined**.
