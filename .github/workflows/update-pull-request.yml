# This workflow updates the pull request description with an auto-generated section containing the categorised commit
# message headers of the pull request's commits. The auto generated section is enveloped between two comments:
# "<!--- START AUTOGENERATED NOTES --->" and "<!--- END AUTOGENERATED NOTES --->". Anything outside these in the
# description is left untouched. Auto-generated updates can be skipped for a commit if
# "<!--- SKIP AUTOGENERATED NOTES --->" is added to the pull request description.
