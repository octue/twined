# This workflow updates the pull request description with an auto-generated section containing the categorised commit
# message headers of the commits since the last pull request merged into main. The auto generated section is enveloped
# between two comments: "<!--- START AUTOGENERATED NOTES --->" and "<!--- END AUTOGENERATED NOTES --->". Anything
# outside these in the description is left untouched. Auto-generated updates can be skipped for a commit if
# "<!--- SKIP AUTOGENERATED NOTES --->" is added to the pull request description.
